### A Brief Introduction

Despite the growing popularity of teaching English overseas, finding a great school to work for is still a challenging task. 

With ESL School Rater, prospective teachers are able to search for schools and view their ratings as given by their current and former teachers. Other users can use the platform to warn others of a Bad School, or to praise an excellent employer.

### The Legacy Version
ESL School Rater has always been a work in progress, and it should be noted that this code is now officially obsolete. A completely new re-write using a PHP framework is imminent, and will hopefully implement new ideas, including:
* More complete profiles for schools,
* User accounts for schools, allowing them to maintain their profiles, respond to teacher ratings, and claim defamation (trolls are everywhere),
* Full support for native scripts (i.e. Chinese characters), including searching.

### Credit

I am proud to say I designed and coded the entire website, from the graphics to the front-end CSS to the back-end PHP, though I admit I nicked the Javascript used for the star rating animation - credit given in stars.js. That said, there are many parts of the source code that I am *not* proud of, and are a major reason why it is being scrapped in favor of yet another complete overhaul. As such, **this code should not be taken as a perfect example of my current skill level.** I have learned a lot since I thought this was good code.
