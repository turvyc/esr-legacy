## Introduction

ESL School Rater (ESR) allows foreign English teachers to review and rate their work experience at an ESL school. As well, teachers looking for a new job or comparing job can use ESR to identify and avoid disreputable schools. 

## Documentation

ESR's documentation will be published on BitBucket's built-in Wiki, which has the advantage of being a git repository itself, so it can be cloned, locally edited, and pushed back to the server. The documentation will be primarily requirement and design specifications, because ESR should be an intuitive enough application to be able to forgo end-user documentation. Internal documentation should adhere to the Coding Standards as described in the Wiki.
